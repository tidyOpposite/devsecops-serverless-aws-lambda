# Scanning Tool Rationale

The CLI is the product surface for enabling, explaining, and checking scanner
gates. GitHub Actions runs the scanners, while `devsecops controls`,
`devsecops readiness`, `devsecops preset`, and `devsecops render` help the
operator choose and validate the active policy.

The kit intentionally separates infrastructure scanning from workload source
scanning. This repository owns the CLI-managed AWS deployment template;
application source, dependencies, and image build hardening belong to the
workload release process that publishes `LAMBDA_IMAGE_URI`.

## Selected Stack

| Layer | Selected tool | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IaC | Trivy config scan | Fast Terraform misconfiguration checks with straightforward GitHub Actions integration and CLI readiness reporting. |
| Container | Snyk Container | Optional deploy gate for known CVEs in the configured Lambda image. The CLI reports whether the gate can run based on config and secrets. |
| DAST | OWASP ZAP baseline | Optional passive HTTP scanning against the deployed API. The CLI keeps it disabled until the operator opts in. |

## CLI Controls

Use the CLI to inspect and configure scanning posture:

```bash
devsecops controls
devsecops explain dast
devsecops preset strict --render
devsecops set enable_dast true --render
devsecops gh-doctor
```

`minimal` and `balanced` keep HTTP validation and DAST conservative by default.
`strict` enables validation controls and is intended for workloads that already
implement `/health` and can tolerate passive dynamic scanning.

## Source SAST And SCA

No sample Lambda application source code is included in this repository, so the
CLI-managed pipeline does not run language-specific SAST or package SCA here.
Add those checks in the repository that builds the Lambda image.

Recommended workload gates:

| Workload layer | Recommended gate |
| --- | --- |
| Source code | Semgrep, CodeQL, Bandit, or an equivalent scanner for the workload language. |
| Dependencies | Snyk, Dependabot, pip-audit, npm audit, or ecosystem-specific SCA. |
| Unit and integration tests | Workload-specific test suite before image publication. |
| Image build | Reproducible build with pinned base image and no mutable production tags. |

## Trivy vs Checkov

| Criterion | Trivy config | Checkov |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage | Terraform, Kubernetes, secrets, and images in one ecosystem. | Deep IaC policy coverage across Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and more. |
| CI ergonomics | Simple GitHub Action, fast config scan, consistent severity filters. | Strong policy framework, but usually more configuration and suppression governance. |
| Fit for this repo | Good default because the repository currently needs a lightweight Terraform gate. | Good alternative if the project needs policy-as-code libraries and compliance mapping. |

Decision: Trivy remains the IaC gate because the CLI benefits from a compact
default scanner with simple operator messaging. Checkov is a good addition if
compliance reporting becomes a product goal.

## OWASP ZAP vs Nuclei

| Criterion | OWASP ZAP baseline | Nuclei |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary fit | Passive HTTP security baseline and spidering. | Template-driven detection for known exposures and CVEs. |
| Strength | Mature web app scanner, useful for headers, cookies, and common HTTP issues. | Fast, broad, and easy to extend with community templates. |
| Risk | Can create noisy warnings if used as a hard gate without tuning. | Template quality and target relevance need governance. |

Decision: OWASP ZAP is optional because this kit does not define the workload
routes. Enable it through the CLI when the deployed workload has an HTTP surface
that is safe for a passive baseline scan.

## Gate Policy

| Finding source | Gate behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Snyk high/critical image vulnerability | Fail deployment when `SNYK_TOKEN` is configured. |
| Trivy high/critical IaC finding | Fail CI. |
| OWASP ZAP fail-level result | Fail deployment validation and trigger Lambda rollback when `ENABLE_DAST=true`. |
| OWASP ZAP warnings | Report but do not fail by default (`-I`) to avoid noisy rollback loops. |
